since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession and more importantly a male-dominated profession previously medicine was seen as a female duty however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries and slowly become male-dominated even the practice of obstetrics which until the twentieth century was still viewed as a female responsibility this rise of medicine has had many implications for women in this essay i will discuss them the most important both in terms of gender and class was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine however i will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment especially in the case of childbirth in terms of class i will look at how working-class women received different treatments as a result of the rise of medicine as a profession and also how consequently the divisions between working-class and upper-class women increased i will begin by looking at one of the most important implications women's exclusion from medicine in previous centuries health care tended to be carried out by female lay-healers within the community witz #### female lay-healers were valued members of the community and as a result gained high status they cared for the sick and elderly and were also relied upon to produce drugs and remedies for their patients moscucci #### as females were seen as closer to the earth it was felt that they were most suited to carrying out the role of carer within the community however medicine slowly began to develop as a form of science rather than an occupation relating to nature and male domination of the occupation began from the ####'s the view developed that rationality and science were most important however these were qualities associated with men rather than women who were seen as emotional and religious not scientific and as the body began to be viewed from a scientific perspective it was these qualities that were required in the practice of medicine donnison #### men also placed emphasis upon these qualities to justify their dominant role within medicine education was introduced to train people in the practice of medicine and in #### the medical registration act secured medicine as a profession witz #### however this also ensured the exclusion of women from medicine as medicine came to be based on qualifications rather than experience patriarchal institutions were able to ensure women were excluded from medicine they were unable to gain entry into the universities offering qualifications in medicine for example the university of edinburgh and prevented from taking exams that would gain them a place on the medical register witz #### although several women including sophie jex blake managed to gain university places they were subject to prejudice and abuse by fellow students and following their entry onto the medical register universities changed their policies ensuring that although women could study medicine they would not necessarily qualify to practice it witz #### this exclusion of women can also be traced in the area of midwifery until the twentieth century midwifery was viewed as a female responsibility being viewed as inferior to other areas although from the ####s onwards there were several man-midwives they did not deal with routine births stepping in only if there was a problem their role was similar to that of a surgeon donnison #### however post-####'s their role changed and they became increasingly involved in routine births especially with the upper and middle classes what was seen as a problem birth was redefined for example prior to this time breech births were regarded as normal and female midwives considered able to deal with them competently but as they came to be seen as a problem male surgeons began to participate in an increasing number oakley #### despite these advances it was not until the twentieth century that midwifery became recognised as central to general practice moscucci #### and qualifications were deemed necessary to practice of midwifery with the #### midwives act oakley #### this resulted in women being further pushed out of an area which they had continued to dominate despite the professionalisation of the rest of medicine this also had class implications as although women were accepted by lying-in hospitals to train in midwifery they had to pay for the privilege ensuring that it was only those from the skilled classes who could qualify donnison #### previously midwifery had been based largely on experience rather than qualification so was practiced by many working-class women overall one of the most important implications for women was their excluded from an occupation previously regarded as female as well as ensuring that only certain classes could enter the profession which limited the options open to women who needed to work it impact can still be seen today as medicine is still a male-dominated practice and the areas that women do enter for example nursing are regarded as inferior to the male-dominated areas such as surgery however it was not the only significant impact another major implication was the way in which women were depicted by the medical profession as men wished to justify their exclusion of women from medicine they redefined how women were viewed as well continuing to portray them as too emotional to enter what they saw as the world of science men also began to associate women's bodies with evil claiming they were inherently dangerous and therefore needed controlling smart #### this would ensure that women were unable to enter medical profession but also that men could retain control over women's bodies however at the same time they also depicted women as frail and therefore dependant upon the male medical practice moscucci #### smart #### both of these depictions ensured that women were unable to enter medicine and guaranteed that it remained a male dominated profession this had class implications for women as those from the working classes were seen as the most dangerous whereas frailty was largely associated with the upper and middle classes which strengthened the divide between the upper and lower classes it also impacted upon legislation with further implications for women as women were construed as dirty and dangerous by the medical profession laws were created reflecting this point for example the contagious diseases acts in the ####'s smart #### which created further controls for women especially those from the working classes the professionalisation of medicine also affected women in a more personal way as it ensured the exclusion of women from medicine it meant that women seeking medical help had to see a male doctor donnison #### a change that caused problems especially in childbirth it resulted in loss of dignity for women as many did not wish to see a male doctor in such situations resulting in many deaths as female midwives were not trained to deal with the problems or meant that male surgeons had to work blind under the covers creating many errors donnison #### this implication was significant as it was so personal and did not just affect women who wished to enter the medical profession but all female patients having discussed the implications for women in relation to gender and in some ways class i will now focus more closely upon the class impacts as the practice of medicine moved away from female lay-healing and towards a male profession many working-class women were denied access to medical care as it became a profession the working classes could no longer afford to receive treatment so many went without donnison #### and the medical profession focused its attention on upper class women claiming they were more fragile and in need of extra help which further excluded working-class women from medical treatment the few hospitals set up to provide for the working classes were poor quality and the women were subjected to harsh treatments which the upper classes who could afford to pay for superior treatment were not they were treated as if they were dirty in some way in a similar way to which prostitutes were handled under the contagious diseases acts moscucci #### upper-class women were able to use chloroform during birth but no such aids were available to those from the working classes donnison #### such differences in treatment helped to increase the division between the working and upper classes that i mentioned previously overall the rise of medicine as a profession had many implications for women it excluded them from the practice an occupation which had previously been female a result which had many further implications for women in both gender and class terms it resulted in the redefining of women into inherently dangerous yet fragile human beings who were therefore dependant upon men and the male medical profession as well as having a negative affect on women patients as many did not wish to see male doctors it also removed one of the final areas of society from which women could gain status ensuring that men now acquired this standing as well as excluding working-class women from treatment as they could no longer afford it increasing the divisions between women of different classes therefore the rise of medicine as a profession turned it into an area of male-dominance reduced women's power and ensured that male control over women increased as did the control of the upper classes over the working classes the rise had a largely negative effect upon women especially those from the working classes and its legacy can still be seen in medicine today        
